Text extraction and cleanup refers to the process of extracting raw text from the input
data by removing all the other non-textual information, such as markup, metadata,
etc., and converting the text to the required encoding format. Typically, this depends
on the format of available data in the organization (e.g., static data from PDF, HTML
or text, some form of continuous data stream, etc.)
